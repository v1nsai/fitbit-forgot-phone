# fitbit-forgot-phone
Notifies on your Fitbit (Versa or Ionic) when your phone is disconnected

Currently, the Fitbit SDK does not allow for apps to run in the background.  The contents of this project therefore need to be rolled into your watch face and recompiled in order to function properly.  I have found a few open source watch faces that I like and will probably be posting some "enhanced" versions of them soon that have the functionality of this project.
